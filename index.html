			<h1>Global Immersion: Africa's Consumer Market - The Case of Ghana</h1>
			
			<h2>Course Overview</h2>
	

			<p>Africa’s consumer market has large potentials. Africa is the world’s second-fastest growing region – 
			after emerging Asia according to the African Development Bank Report. About half of the growth of 
			the continent’s GDP growth is due to consumer-facing industries. 1.3 billion people live in Africa and 
according to the United Nations, the population is expected to increase to 2.5 billion by 2050. The 
working-class population in Africa is growing by 2.7 percent each year (compared to 1.3 percent in 
Latin America and 1.2 percent in Southeast Asia). McKinsey projects that by 2025 two-thirds of the 
estimated 303 million African households will have discretionary income and consumer spending will 
reach $2.1 trillion.1 Not surprisingly, many firms and investors are trying to tap into Africa’s consumer 
market.</p>
